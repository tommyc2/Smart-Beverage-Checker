## Description
 - Concept: Waterproof Temperature Sensor Device that alerts you when your hot beverage is cold/hot. When the temperature sensor reaches a certain temperature (low enough), the blue LED turns on to alert the user, signalling their drink is gone cold or the surrounding area is cold. When the temperature is between a certain set of values, a yellow LED displays signalling the temperature is stable. When the temperature is above a cloud "threshold" value, the red LED comes on signalling the drink is hot.
