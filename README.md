## Description
 - Concept: Smart Beverage Temp checker device that alerts you when your drink is cold/hot. When the temperature sensor reaches a low temperature, the blue LED turns on to alert the user, signalling their drink is gone cold with an email notification. When the temperature is between the threshold and a reduced value, a yellow LED displays signalling the temperature is stable. When the temperature is above the threshold value, the red LED comes on signalling the drink is hot.
